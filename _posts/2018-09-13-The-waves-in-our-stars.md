Each person is like a wave.
They look different from far, like a wave, which looks very gigantic from far but as it/they get close to you, you're fine with it, you get to spend time, you enjoy the moment.

Like every other wave, it's imminent that they will fade or leave or disappear. Sometimes they leave even before they reach the shore, like when a wave looks promising to hit the shore hard but dies even before it develops into anything meaningful, we all have those waves in our lives where there are so many "What Ifs" and So many Could haves " in a relationship which looks promising but never lives it's potential. sometimes they reach deeper and deeper and reduce the distance between the shore (you) and the water (them), they get to know you so well, they become a part of you, you feel complete and give them a place in your heart, but they will leave, and when they do, and when the scorching sun hits you after that dizzy night, it burns, sets scars which leave traces which never leave you, but, what happens when the wave covers you from all sides and never leaves you, and you love it so much that you start drowning and start feeling that there is no escape, yes, that's what happens to an Island which starts disappearing when water level rises, but again, like the Island even you will be reborn once you decide to come out of the water, like an Island fights its way and the water level drops, too much of anything is surely good for nothing, said a wise man once.

Sometimes the waves give you something and leave, sometimes their everything, like the waves throwing random objects out, which are the only things that they have, but, those random things are of no use to you, you don't expect anything which they offer, but the waves don't know that because their only aim was to give you their everything, like a lover should do, but then who is at mistake here? The wave or the shore?

Sometimes they destroy your sand castles and leave you distraught, the sand castles which you built so carefully, each layer with so much care, the castles which your parents, your friends and everyone around you who cares for you helped you build it and watched in awe when it turned out beautiful, but we always let that one wave hit our shores and destroy our beautiful lives.

Life teaches the way of living and leaving through nature, always, Observe, you will understand.

Enjoy your waves until they last.
